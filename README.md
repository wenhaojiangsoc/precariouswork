# Bad Health, Bad Jobs

Repository for replication codes and data for the paper *Bad Health, Bad Jobs*, currently at the stage of work under progress.

## Overview about the Repository

This repository hosts original raw data and the codes that clean, transform and analyze it for the final results in the paper. For replication questions, please reach out to Wenhao at `wj2068@nyu.edu`.

### Data
 
We include two kinds of data to repoduce the main results. 

* `data source`: the folder includes the file `precarious.NLSY97` that contains variable names and indices to be uploaded to the [NLSY97 official website](https://www.nlsinfo.org/investigator/pages/login). This will automatically include all variables needed in our analyses. After downloading the data from the website, you will get the `precarious.csv` file, along with other auxilary ones in the folder.

* `data cleaned`: the folder includes the main cleaned data, `master_01.csv`, for our analysis. We also keep the original sampling weights in `weight.csv`, which is needed for the main analysis.

### Code

We include three sets of codes
