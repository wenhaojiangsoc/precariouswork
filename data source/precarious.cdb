valid non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is
used as the truncation level ($40,000 for this variable).  Values for all cases 
at or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the

  PRIMARY VARIABLE

             GRIT SCORE (8 ITEM)
 
The 8-Item Grit Scale measures the level of 'grittiness' and was developed by 
Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews, and Kelly (2007). Respondents are asked to 
indicate (5-point scale) how much the following items are like them:   1. New 
ideas sometimes distract me from previous ones. [YSAQ-GRIT-1/YEND-SAQ-GRIT-1] 
(reverse coded)  2. Setbacks don't discourage me.  [YSAQ-GRIT-2/YEND-SAQ-GRIT-2]
3. I have been obsessed with a certain idea or project for a short time but 
later lost interest. [YSAQ-GRIT-3/YEND-SAQ-GRIT-3] (reverse coded)  4. I am a 
hard worker. [YSAQ-GRIT-4/YEND-SAQ-GRIT-4]  5. I often set a goal but later 
choose to pursue a different one.[YSAQ-GRIT-5/YEND-SAQ-GRIT-5] (reverse coded)  
6. I have difficulty maintaining my focus on projects that take more than a few 
months to complete. [YSAQ-GRIT-6/YEND-SAQ-GRIT-6] (reverse coded)  7. I finish 
whatever I begin.[YSAQ-GRIT-7/YEND-SAQ-GRIT-7]  8. I am 
diligent.[YSAQ\GRIT\8/YEND-SAQ-GRIT-8]
 
The items are summed and divided by 8; If one item is missing, the scale score 
is coded as missing.
 
NOTE: This scale was asked of all respondents interviewed in Round 16. 
Non-interivewed respondents were asked this set in Round 17 or Round 18 (if they
weren't interviewed in Round 16 or Round 17).
